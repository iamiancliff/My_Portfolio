## 🚀 About Me

I'm an aspiring Cloud Engineer driven by curiosity, problem-solving, and a desire to build impactful systems.

I transitioned into tech with a focus on **cloud computing, automation, and software development**. I’ve been actively working on **hands-on AWS projects**, gaining practical experience in services like EC2, S3, Lambda, and RDS.

Besides cloud, I enjoy writing clean code, developing backend systems with **Python**, and exploring tools that improve performance and reliability. I thrive in dynamic, collaborative environments where I can keep learning and contribute meaningfully.

🎯 **Current Goal**: Deepen my knowledge in **AWS architecture**, **DevOps**, **automation workflows**, and **Software Engineering**.
